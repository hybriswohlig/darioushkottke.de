        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p class="legal-subtitle"><strong>Effective Date: February 18, 2026</strong></p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
            By accessing or using this restricted internal compliance documentation portal (the &quot;Portal&quot;), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use (the &quot;Terms&quot;). If you do not agree, you must immediately cease all use of the Portal. These Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and <strong>N&amp;E INNOVATIONS PTE. LTD.</strong> (&quot;Company&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, or &quot;our&quot;).
        </p>

        <h2>2. Authorized Use</h2>
        <p>
            This Portal is intended <strong>exclusively for authorized business users and partners</strong> of N&amp;E Innovations Pte. Ltd. Any unauthorized access or use is strictly prohibited. Access is granted solely for legitimate business evaluation purposes related to our products and services. You may view, download, and internally use the materials made available through the Portal, including all regulatory, quality, product-related documentation and <strong>Environmental Impact Assessments</strong> of N&amp;E Innovations products, provided you remain an authorized user. You may not share access credentials, permit third-party access, or use the Portal for any competitive or commercial purpose unrelated to evaluating our offerings.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>
            Materials made available through this Portal may be confidential or intended for due diligence purposes. By accessing the Portal, you agree to treat such materials (including but not limited to Environmental Impact Assessments, technical specifications, regulatory filings, and quality documentation) as <strong>strictly confidential</strong>. You shall use them solely for evaluating N&amp;E Innovations products/services and shall not disclose, reproduce, or distribute them to any third party unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing by the Company. This confidentiality obligation survives termination of your access.
        </p>

        <h2>4. No Warranty</h2>
        <p>
            All documentation and content provided through the Portal is furnished &quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as available&quot; for business evaluation purposes only. N&amp;E Innovations Pte. Ltd. <strong>disclaims all warranties</strong>, express or implied, to the fullest extent permitted by law, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, completeness, non-infringement, and uninterrupted access. We do not warrant that the Portal or its content will meet your specific requirements or that access will be error-free or secure at all times.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
            All content, materials, logos, designs, and documentation available on the Portal, including Environmental Impact Assessments and compliance documentation, remain the <strong>exclusive property</strong> of N&amp;E Innovations Pte. Ltd. or its licensors. No rights, title, or interest are granted to you except for the limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to view and internally use the materials solely for authorized business evaluation purposes during the term of your access. You may not copy, modify, distribute, create derivative works from, or otherwise exploit any content without our prior written consent.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Security and Prohibited Conduct</h2>
        <p>
            You must not attempt to bypass authentication, probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of the Portal, or interfere with its operation in any way. <strong>Prohibited activities</strong> include (but are not limited to) reverse engineering, decompiling, attempting unauthorized entry, introducing malware, overloading systems, or using automated tools (e.g., bots, scrapers) without explicit permission. Any violation may result in immediate suspension or termination of access and potential legal action. We reserve the right to monitor usage for security and compliance purposes (see our <a href="/privacy.php">Privacy Policy</a> for details).
        </p>

        <h2>7. User Accounts and Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
            Access requires valid credentials issued only to authorized representatives of your organization. You are responsible for <strong>maintaining the confidentiality</strong> of your account information and for all activities conducted under your credentials. You agree to notify us immediately of any suspected unauthorized use. Accounts are personal to the authorized individual and may not be shared or transferred.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Termination and Suspension</h2>
        <p>
            We may suspend or terminate your access to the Portal at any time, with or without notice, for any reason, including breach of these Terms, cessation of your business relationship with us, or operational needs. Upon termination, all rights granted to you cease immediately, and you must destroy or return all downloaded materials. Sections 3 (Confidentiality), 4 (No Warranty), 5 (Intellectual Property), 9 (Limitation of Liability), 10 (Indemnification), and 11 (Governing Law) shall <strong>survive termination</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company shall <strong>not be liable</strong> for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of the Portal, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Our total aggregate liability shall not exceed the greater of <strong>EUR 1,000</strong> or the amount you paid us in the twelve months preceding the claim (if any). This limitation applies regardless of the legal theory.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
            You agree to <strong>indemnify, defend, and hold harmless</strong> the Company, its officers, directors, employees, and affiliates from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to your breach of these Terms, unauthorized use of the Portal, or violation of applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the <strong>Republic of Singapore</strong>, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles. Any disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the <strong>courts of Singapore</strong>. You irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such courts.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Miscellaneous</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding the Portal and supersede all prior understandings. If any provision is held invalid, the remainder remains in full force. We may amend these Terms at any time by posting the revised version on the Portal; continued use constitutes acceptance. No waiver of any breach shall constitute a waiver of any other breach. You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent.
